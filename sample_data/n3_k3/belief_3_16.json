However, the interaction effects between SES and race are not statistically significant, indicating that the impact of SES on class percentile does not significantly differ across racial groups in this dataset.

The model includes interaction terms between SES and race.\\n\\nKey findings from the model summary:\\n\\n- **Intercept**: The baseline percentile for the reference group (Black students with average SES) is 41.47, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **SAMPLE_RACE[T.Hispanic]**: Hispanic students have a higher class percentile by 3.55 points compared to Black students, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **SAMPLE_RACE[T.White]**: White students have a significantly higher class percentile by 8.56 points compared to Black students (p < 0.001).\\n- **SES**: A one-unit increase in SES is associated with an 8.16 point increase in class percentile, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **Interaction Terms**:\\n  - **SES:SAMPLE_RACE[T.Hispanic]**: The interaction term is 1.09, suggesting a slight increase in percentile for Hispanic students with higher SES, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.363).\\n  - **SES:SAMPLE_RACE[T.White]**: The interaction term is 1.21, indicating a slight increase in percentile for White students with higher SES, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.216).\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n- The model suggests that both race and SES independently contribute to differences in class percentile, with White students and those with higher SES achieving higher percentiles. However, the interaction effects between SES and race are not statistically significant, indicating that the impact of SES on class percentile does not significantly differ across racial groups in this dataset. This analysis highlights the importance of both race and SES in educational outcomes, but suggests that their interaction may not be as influential.\"}",

The model includes interaction terms between SES and race.\\n\\nKey findings from the model summary:\\n\\n- **Intercept**: The baseline percentile for the reference group (Black students with average SES) is 41.47, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **SAMPLE_RACE[T.Hispanic]**: Hispanic students have a higher class percentile by 3.55 points compared to Black students, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **SAMPLE_RACE[T.White]**: White students have a significantly higher class percentile by 8.56 points compared to Black students (p < 0.001).\\n- **SES**: A one-unit increase in SES is associated with an 8.16 point increase in class percentile, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **Interaction Terms**:\\n  - **SES:SAMPLE_RACE[T.Hispanic]**: The interaction term is 1.09, suggesting a slight increase in percentile for Hispanic students with higher SES, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.363).\\n  - **SES:SAMPLE_RACE[T.White]**: The interaction term is 1.21, indicating a slight increase in percentile for White students with higher SES, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.216).\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n- The model suggests that both race and SES independently contribute to differences in class percentile, with White students and those with higher SES achieving higher percentiles. However, the interaction effects between SES and race are not statistically significant, indicating that the impact of SES on class percentile does not significantly differ across racial groups in this dataset. This analysis highlights the importance of both race and SES in educational outcomes, but suggests that their interaction may not be as influential.\"}",

This experiment will involve conducting correlation analyses to determine if there is a significant relationship between family size and these academic metrics. Additionally, a linear regression model can be used to control for other variables such as SES, race, and gender to see if family size still has a significant impact. This analysis will help understand if larger family sizes correlate with lower academic performance, potentially due to resource dilution or other factors.\"},{\"title\":\"Longitudinal Analysis of SES Impact on Educational Attainment\",\"description\":\"Conduct a longitudinal analysis to explore how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over time affect educational attainment, specifically the completion of a BA degree. This experiment will involve creating a time-series dataset from the existing data, if possible, or simulating changes in SES over time. The analysis will use survival analysis techniques to model the time to BA degree completion as a function of SES changes. This will provide insights into whether improvements or declines in SES during formative years significantly impact the likelihood of completing higher education.\"},{\"title\":\"Exploring the Role of Curriculum on BA Degree Completion\",\"description\":\"Analyze the impact of high school curriculum type on the likelihood of completing a BA degree. This experiment will involve categorizing respondents based on their high school curriculum (e.g., general, vocational, college preparatory) and using logistic regression to model the probability of BA degree completion. The analysis will control for other factors such as SES, race, and gender to isolate the effect of curriculum type. This study aims to identify if certain curricula better prepare students for higher education success, potentially informing educational policy and guidance.\"}]}",
