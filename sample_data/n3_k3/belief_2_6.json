The findings are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Correlation Analysis**:\\n   - The correlation between family size and class percentile is -0.154, indicating a weak inverse relationship. This suggests that larger family sizes are slightly associated with lower academic performance, but the relationship is not strong.\\n\\n2. **Regression Analysis**:\\n   - The regression model includes family size, SES, and composite ASVAB scores as predictors of class percentile.\\n   - The R-squared value is 0.490, indicating that approximately 49% of the variance in class percentile is explained by the model.\\n   - The coefficient for family size is 0.2315, which is statistically significant (p = 0.011). This suggests that, contrary to the initial hypothesis, larger family sizes are associated with a slight increase in class percentile when controlling for SES and ASVAB scores.\\n   - SES has a negative coefficient (-0.9895) and is statistically significant (p = 0.001), indicating that higher SES is associated with lower class percentile, which is counterintuitive and may require further investigation.\\n   - The composite ASVAB score has a positive and significant effect (coefficient = 0.0531, p < 0.001), indicating that higher cognitive ability is associated with better academic performance.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis suggests that while family size has a weak inverse correlation with academic performance, its effect becomes positive when controlling for SES and ASVAB scores. This highlights the complexity of factors influencing academic outcomes and suggests that family size alone may not be a strong predictor of academic success.\"}",
