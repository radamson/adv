The analysis involved calculating the correlation coefficient, visualizing the data with scatter plots, and fitting a linear regression model.\\n\\n**Findings:**\\n\\n1. **Correlation Analysis:**\\n   - The correlation coefficient between SES and ASVAB scores is 0.463, indicating a moderate positive correlation. The p-value is 0.0, suggesting the correlation is statistically significant.\\n\\n2. **Scatter Plot:**\\n   - The scatter plot with a regression line shows a positive trend, suggesting that higher SES is associated with higher ASVAB scores. Data points are densely clustered around the center, with a few outliers, particularly at higher SES values.\\n\\n3. **Linear Regression Model:**\\n   - The linear regression model yielded an intercept of 1949.18 and a coefficient for SES of 215.68. This suggests that for each unit increase in SES, the ASVAB score increases by approximately 215.68 points.\\n   - The regression line in the plot indicates a positive linear relationship, although there is a significant spread of data points around the line, suggesting variability in ASVAB scores for similar SES values.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe analysis suggests a positive correlation between SES and ASVAB scores, indicating that higher socioeconomic status is generally associated with higher cognitive ability as measured by ASVAB scores. However, the variability in scores suggests that other factors may also influence ASVAB performance.\\n\\n**Limitations:**\\nThe analysis does not account for other variables that might influence ASVAB scores, and the presence of outliers may affect the interpretation of the correlation and regression results.
