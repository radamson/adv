This analysis will involve creating a new variable that indicates whether a respondent participated in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, clubs) during high school. Use linear regression to model class percentile as a function of extracurricular participation, controlling for SES, race, gender, and family size. The goal is to determine if participation in extracurricular activities is associated with higher academic performance, potentially due to improved time management, social skills, or motivation.\"},{\"title\":\"Longitudinal Analysis of SES Impact on Educational Attainment\",\"description\":\"Conduct a longitudinal analysis to explore how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over time affect educational attainment, specifically the completion of a BA degree. This experiment will involve creating a dataset that tracks changes in SES for respondents over multiple years, if such data is available. Use a mixed-effects model to account for individual variability and time-dependent changes in SES. The objective is to determine if improvements in SES over time increase the likelihood of completing a BA degree, providing insights into the long-term impact of socioeconomic mobility on education.\"},{\"title\":\"Influence of Parental Education on Student Academic Outcomes\",\"description\":\"Investigate the influence of parental education levels on student academic outcomes, specifically class percentile and BA degree completion. This experiment will involve adding a new variable representing the highest education level attained by either parent. Use logistic regression to model the probability of BA degree completion and linear regression for class percentile, both as functions of parental education, controlling for SES, race, gender, and family size. The aim is to assess whether higher parental education levels are associated with better academic outcomes for students, potentially due to increased academic support and expectations at home.\"}]}",
