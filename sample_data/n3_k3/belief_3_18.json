The results are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Model Summary**:\\n   - The R-squared value is 0.521, indicating that approximately 52.1% of the variance in class percentile is explained by the model.\\n   - The model includes race, gender, SES, composite ASVAB scores, and interaction terms between race and gender.\\n\\n2. **Key Findings**:\\n   - **Race Effects**:\\n     - Hispanic and White races have negative coefficients (-5.8393 and -6.7326, respectively), indicating lower class percentiles compared to the reference category (likely Black, as it was dropped in dummy variable creation). These effects are statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n   - **Gender Effects**:\\n     - Being male is associated with a lower class percentile (coefficient = -7.7255, p < 0.001).\\n   - **Interaction Effects**:\\n     - The interaction term for Hispanic males (Race_Hispanic_Gender_Male) has a positive coefficient (2.4754, p = 0.019), suggesting that Hispanic males perform better than expected based on the main effects of race and gender alone.\\n   - **Other Variables**:\\n     - SES has a small negative effect on class percentile (coefficient = -0.6544, p = 0.026), while composite ASVAB scores have a strong positive effect (coefficient = 0.0561, p < 0.001).\\n\\nThese results indicate that race and gender, along with their interaction, significantly influence academic performance. The interaction effect suggests that the impact of race and gender is not simply additive, highlighting the importance of considering intersectionality in educational outcomes. The analysis also confirms the strong influence of cognitive ability (ASVAB scores) on academic performance.\"}",

The results are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Model Summary**:\\n   - The R-squared value is 0.521, indicating that approximately 52.1% of the variance in class percentile is explained by the model.\\n   - The model includes race, gender, SES, composite ASVAB scores, and interaction terms between race and gender.\\n\\n2. **Key Findings**:\\n   - **Race Effects**:\\n     - Hispanic and White races have negative coefficients (-5.8393 and -6.7326, respectively), indicating lower class percentiles compared to the reference category (likely Black, as it was dropped in dummy variable creation). These effects are statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n   - **Gender Effects**:\\n     - Being male is associated with a lower class percentile (coefficient = -7.7255, p < 0.001).\\n   - **Interaction Effects**:\\n     - The interaction term for Hispanic males (Race_Hispanic_Gender_Male) has a positive coefficient (2.4754, p = 0.019), suggesting that Hispanic males perform better than expected based on the main effects of race and gender alone.\\n   - **Other Variables**:\\n     - SES has a small negative effect on class percentile (coefficient = -0.6544, p = 0.026), while composite ASVAB scores have a strong positive effect (coefficient = 0.0561, p < 0.001).\\n\\nThese results indicate that race and gender, along with their interaction, significantly influence academic performance. The interaction effect suggests that the impact of race and gender is not simply additive, highlighting the importance of considering intersectionality in educational outcomes. The analysis also confirms the strong influence of cognitive ability (ASVAB scores) on academic performance.\"}",
