This suggests that the interaction between family size and SES has a small but significant negative effect on class percentile.\\n   - The R-squared value was 0.119, indicating that the model explains about 11.9% of the variance in class percentile.\\n\\n2. **ABILITY: COMPOSITE OF ASVAB SCORE**:\\n   - The interaction term was not statistically significant (p = 0.312), indicating that the interaction between family size and SES does not significantly affect ASVAB scores.\\n   - The R-squared value was 0.279, suggesting that the model explains about 27.9% of the variance in ASVAB scores.\\n\\n### 3D Plot Analysis:\\n- The 3D scatter plots for both outcomes showed dense clustering of data points, indicating a concentration of values around the middle ranges of family size and SES.\\n- There were no clear trends or outliers, suggesting that within the observed range, family size and SES do not have a strong impact on either class percentile or ASVAB scores.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe analysis indicates that while there is a statistically significant interaction effect on class percentile, the practical impact is minimal. For ASVAB scores, the interaction effect is not significant.
