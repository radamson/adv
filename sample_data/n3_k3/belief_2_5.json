This indicates a statistically significant difference in ASVAB scores between males and females, with males having higher average scores.\\n\\n**Boxplot Analysis:**\\n- The boxplot shows that both genders have similar median ASVAB scores, and the interquartile range (IQR) is also similar, suggesting a similar spread of scores.\\n- There is an outlier in the male category, which may influence the results and warrants further investigation.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n- Despite the similar distribution of scores as shown in the boxplot, the t-test indicates a significant difference in mean ASVAB scores between genders. This suggests that males, on average, have higher ASVAB scores than females in this dataset.
