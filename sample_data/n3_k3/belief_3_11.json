The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics.\\n\\n**Model Performance:**\\n- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 19.30, which indicates the average deviation of the predicted class rank from the actual rank. This value suggests that the model's predictions are, on average, about 19.3 percentile points away from the true class rank.\\n- **R-squared:** 0.438, meaning that approximately 43.8% of the variance in class rank is explained by the model. This indicates a moderate level of predictive power, suggesting that while the model captures some of the factors influencing class rank, there is still a significant portion of variance unexplained.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe Random Forest model provides a reasonable prediction of class rank, with ASVAB scores likely being a significant predictor given their direct relation to academic ability. However, the moderate R-squared value suggests that other unmeasured factors may also play a role in determining class rank. This model can be a useful tool for educators and policymakers to identify key predictors of academic success, but further refinement and inclusion of additional variables could improve its predictive accuracy.\"}",
