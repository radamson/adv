The correlation coefficient was found to be -0.154, with a p-value of approximately 6.79e-48, indicating a statistically significant but weak negative correlation between family size and class percentile.\\n\\nThe scatter plot showed a wide distribution of class percentiles across different family sizes, with no apparent trend or strong correlation. This suggests that family size does not have a significant impact on a student's percentile in class, as students from all family sizes are represented across the full range of percentiles.\\n\\nThe box plot further supported this finding, showing that the median percentile in class is relatively consistent across different family sizes, with similar interquartile ranges (IQRs). This indicates that the variability in class percentiles is consistent across family sizes, and family size does not significantly affect a student's academic performance.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis suggests that while there is a statistically significant correlation, the practical impact of family size on academic performance is minimal. Other factors, such as socioeconomic status or access to educational resources, might play a more significant role in influencing academic outcomes.\"}",
