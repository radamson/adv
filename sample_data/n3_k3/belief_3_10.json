The simulated dataset included 1,000 individuals tracked over 5 years, with random SES changes and BA degree completion status.\\n\\n**Mixed-Effects Model Results:**\\n- **Intercept**: The baseline probability of completing a BA degree is approximately 0.296, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\\n- **SES**: The coefficient for SES is -0.000, indicating no significant effect of SES changes on the likelihood of completing a BA degree (p = 0.951). This suggests that, in the simulated data, changes in SES do not significantly influence educational attainment.\\n- **CASE ID Variance**: The variance component for individual variability is very small, indicating minimal random effects at the individual level.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe simulated analysis suggests that changes in SES do not significantly impact the likelihood of completing a BA degree in this dataset. However, it is important to note that this is a simulated scenario, and real longitudinal data might yield different results. The lack of significant findings could be due to the random nature of the simulated SES changes or the need for more complex modeling to capture the dynamics of SES and educational attainment.\"}",
