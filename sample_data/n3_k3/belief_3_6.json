Most data points are clustered around the center, with a few outliers, particularly at higher SES values. This indicates variability in scores across SES levels but supports the hypothesis that SES positively influences ASVAB performance.\\n\\nFurther stratification by race and gender revealed that the positive correlation persists across these groups. White individuals tend to have higher ASVAB scores across SES levels compared to Hispanic and Black individuals, suggesting racial disparities in ASVAB performance. The gender difference is less pronounced, indicating that SES impacts ASVAB scores similarly for both males and females.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis suggests that socioeconomic status is a significant factor influencing ASVAB scores, with higher SES linked to better performance.
