A three-way ANOVA was conducted to test for interaction effects, and interaction plots were used to visualize the results.\\n\\n**ANOVA Results:**\\n- The main effects of race, gender, and SES on academic performance were statistically significant, with p-values less than 0.05.\\n- The interaction between race and gender was not statistically significant (p = 0.077), indicating that the combined effect of race and gender on academic performance is not significant.\\n- The interaction between gender and SES was statistically significant (p = 0.000577), suggesting that the effect of SES on academic performance varies by gender.\\n- The three-way interaction between race, gender, and SES was not statistically significant (p = 0.5918), indicating that the combined effect of these three factors on academic performance is not significant.\\n\\n**Visualizations:**\\n- The interaction plot for SES and gender showed a dense distribution of data points with no apparent correlation between SES and class percentile, regardless of gender. This suggests that SES does not have a significant impact on class percentile, and there is no observable gender difference in this relationship.\\n- The interaction plot for SES and race also showed a diverse distribution of class percentiles across different SES levels and races, with no clear trend or clustering. This indicates that SES does not have a straightforward impact on class percentile, and racial groups are distributed throughout the SES spectrum without clear patterns.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe analysis suggests that while race, gender, and SES individually impact academic performance, their combined interaction does not significantly influence outcomes. The significant interaction between gender and SES indicates that SES may affect males and females differently, but the overall impact of these factors together is not substantial. Further research could explore additional variables or more nuanced interactions to better understand these dynamics.\"}",

This suggests that SES does not have a significant impact on class percentile, and there is no observable gender difference in this relationship.\\n- The interaction plot for SES and race also showed a diverse distribution of class percentiles across different SES levels and races, with no clear trend or clustering. This indicates that SES does not have a straightforward impact on class percentile, and racial groups are distributed throughout the SES spectrum without clear patterns.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe analysis suggests that while race, gender, and SES individually impact academic performance, their combined interaction does not significantly influence outcomes. The significant interaction between gender and SES indicates that SES may affect males and females differently, but the overall impact of these factors together is not substantial.
