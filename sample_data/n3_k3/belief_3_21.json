Use statistical tests such as t-tests or chi-square tests to determine if there are significant differences between genders. Additionally, visualize the distribution of SES and degree completion rates by gender using histograms or box plots. This analysis aims to uncover potential gender disparities in education and socioeconomic outcomes.\"},{\"title\":\"Impact of Family Size on Academic Performance\",\"description\":\"Investigate the relationship between family size and academic performance, as measured by the 'PERCENTILE IN CLASS' variable. Analyze whether larger family sizes correlate with lower or higher academic performance. Use statistical methods such as correlation analysis or regression to quantify the relationship. Additionally, visualize the distribution of class percentiles across different family sizes using scatter plots or box plots. This analysis aims to understand how family size might influence educational outcomes.\"}]}",
