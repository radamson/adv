This suggests a positive association between cognitive ability (as measured by ASVAB scores) and SES, supporting the hypothesis that higher cognitive ability is associated with higher socioeconomic status.\\n- **BA Degree Completed**: The coefficient is -0.1078, which is statistically significant (p = 0.015). Interestingly, this negative coefficient suggests that completing a BA degree is associated with a decrease in SES, contrary to typical expectations. This result may require further investigation to understand underlying factors or potential data issues.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis indicates that cognitive ability positively correlates with SES, while the relationship between educational attainment and SES is unexpectedly negative.
