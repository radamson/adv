This indicates a statistically significant difference in SES between genders, with females having slightly higher SES scores on average.\\n   - The box plot of SES distribution by gender shows similar median values and interquartile ranges for both genders, with outliers present in both groups. This suggests that while the central tendency is similar, there are some differences in the tails of the distribution.\\n\\n2. **BA Degree Completion Rates by Gender**:\\n   - A chi-square test was performed to compare BA degree completion rates between genders, resulting in a chi-square statistic of 2.16 and a p-value of 0.141. This suggests no statistically significant difference in BA degree completion rates between males and females.\\n   - The bar plot shows that females have a slightly higher proportion of BA degree completion compared to males, although the difference is not statistically significant.\\n\\nOverall, the analysis suggests that while there is a significant difference in SES scores between genders, with females having slightly higher scores, there is no significant difference in BA degree completion rates.
