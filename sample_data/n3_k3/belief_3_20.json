The model used academic and demographic characteristics to predict changes in socioeconomic status (SES), with the current SES serving as a proxy for change.

This indicates a relatively low predictive power, suggesting that the model may not capture all factors influencing SES changes.\\n\\n2. **Feature Importances**:\\n   - The most important predictor of SES is the 'ABILITY: COMPOSITE OF ASVAB SCORE', with a feature importance score of 0.694. This highlights the significant role of cognitive ability in determining socioeconomic outcomes.\\n   - 'FAMILY SIZE OF SAMPLE' is the second most important predictor, with a feature importance score of 0.176, indicating its moderate influence on SES.\\n   - Gender ('SAMPLE_SEX_Male') and race ('SAMPLE_RACE_Hispanic' and 'SAMPLE_RACE_White') have lower importance scores, suggesting a lesser impact on SES compared to cognitive ability and family size.\\n   - 'BA DEGREE COMPLETED' has the lowest importance score, indicating minimal influence on SES in this model.\\n\\nOverall, while the model identifies key predictors of SES, its low R-squared value suggests that additional factors not included in the model may also play a significant role in socioeconomic mobility.
