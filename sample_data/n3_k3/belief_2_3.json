The coefficient for family size is -28.28, meaning that each additional family member is associated with a decrease of approximately 28.28 points in the ASVAB composite score, holding other factors constant.\\n- The model also shows that SES has a significant positive effect on ASVAB scores, with a coefficient of 186.85.\\n- Race also plays a significant role, with Hispanic and White respondents having higher ASVAB scores compared to the reference group (likely Black, based on typical coding practices).\\n- The model's R-squared value is 0.347, indicating that approximately 34.7% of the variance in ASVAB scores is explained by the model.\\n\\nOverall, the findings support the hypothesis that larger family sizes are associated with lower academic abilities, even after controlling for SES and race.
