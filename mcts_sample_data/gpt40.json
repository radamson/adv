The models included interaction terms to explore whether the impact of SES on academic performance differs between males and females.\\n\\n### Key Findings:\\n\\n1. **ASVAB Scores Model**:\\n   - The interaction term between SES and gender (SES_Gender_Interaction) is statistically significant (p = 0.010), suggesting that the effect of SES on ASVAB scores does differ between males and females.\\n   - The coefficient for SES_Gender_Interaction is negative, indicating that the positive impact of SES on ASVAB scores is less pronounced for females compared to males.\\n\\n2. **Class Percentile Model**:\\n   - The interaction term between SES and gender is not statistically significant (p = 0.989), indicating that SES does not have a differential impact on class percentile based on gender.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nThe analysis suggests that while SES has a differential impact on ASVAB scores between genders, it does not significantly affect class percentile differently for males and females. This highlights the complexity of how SES interacts with gender to influence different aspects of academic achievement. Further investigation could explore additional factors or use alternative modeling approaches to better understand these dynamics.\"}",
